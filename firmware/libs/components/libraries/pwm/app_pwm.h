 * @brief Module for generating a pulse-width modulated output signal.
 *
 * @details This module provides a PWM implementation using timers, GPIOTE, and PPI.
 *
 * Each PWM instance utilizes 1 timer, 2 PPI channels, and 1 PPI channel group
 * plus 2 PPI and 1 GPIOTE channels per PWM channel. The maximum number of PWM
 * channels per instance is 2.
